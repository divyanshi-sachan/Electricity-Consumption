# Analysis Philosophy

## Core Principles

### 1. Data-Driven Decision Making
All conclusions and recommendations are grounded in empirical evidence from the data. We avoid making assumptions without data validation.

### 2. Multi-Perspective Analysis
We examine electricity consumption from multiple angles:
- **Temporal**: Understanding how demand evolves over time
- **Spatial**: Recognizing regional differences and their causes
- **Sectoral**: Distinguishing between different user types
- **Systemic**: Understanding the interaction between supply and demand

### 3. Causal Thinking
We move beyond correlation to understand causation:
- Why does demand spike in certain regions?
- What drives seasonal variations?
- How do economic factors influence consumption?

### 4. Uncertainty Quantification
All predictions include uncertainty estimates. We acknowledge that forecasts are probabilistic, not deterministic.

### 5. Actionable Insights
Our analysis always aims to provide actionable recommendations:
- Clear identification of problem areas
- Prioritized investment recommendations
- Realistic implementation strategies

## Hypothesis Formation Approach

### 1. Exploratory Hypothesis Generation
- Start with broad questions from domain knowledge
- Use data exploration to refine hypotheses
- Formulate specific, testable hypotheses

### 2. Literature-Informed Hypotheses
- Review existing research on electricity demand
- Learn from similar studies in other regions
- Apply established theories (e.g., economic growth → energy demand)

### 3. Domain Expert Consultation
- Consider input from energy sector experts
- Understand practical constraints
- Validate assumptions with real-world knowledge

## Validation Strategy

### 1. Statistical Validation
- Use appropriate statistical tests
- Validate model assumptions
- Check for overfitting

### 2. Cross-Validation
- Temporal cross-validation for time series
- Regional cross-validation for spatial models
- Out-of-sample testing

### 3. External Validation
- Compare with official forecasts
- Validate against known events
- Check consistency with domain knowledge

## Ethical Considerations

- **Privacy**: Ensure no personally identifiable information is used
- **Transparency**: Document all methods and assumptions
- **Bias**: Check for and mitigate potential biases in data or analysis
- **Reproducibility**: Make all code and data processing steps reproducible

## Communication Philosophy

- **Clarity**: Present findings in accessible language
- **Visualization**: Use clear, informative visualizations
- **Context**: Provide necessary context for interpretation
- **Limitations**: Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties
- **Recommendations**: Make recommendations specific and actionable
