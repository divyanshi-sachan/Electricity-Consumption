# Research Methodology

This folder contains documentation of our research methodology, theoretical foundation, and approach.

## Overview

Our methodology documentation covers:
- Theoretical foundation
- Research design
- Model selection rationale
- Validation strategy
- Limitations and assumptions

## Evaluation Criteria

For **Research Methodology (20 marks)**, we need:
- ✅ **Literature-Grounded**: Based on established research
- ✅ **Technically Sound**: Appropriate methods and techniques
- ✅ **Well-Documented**: Clear explanation of approach
- ✅ **Proactive**: Anticipates challenges and addresses them

## Key Documents

- `theoretical_foundation.md` - Theoretical basis for our approach
- `research_design.md` - Overall research design
- **`model_selection_rationale.md`** - Why we chose specific models (ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, Ensemble) ⭐
- **`validation_strategy.md`** - How we validate our results (train/test split, cross-validation, metrics) ⭐
- **`limitations_assumptions.md`** - Known limitations and assumptions (data, models, external factors) ⭐
- **`data_preprocessing_methodology.md`** - Data preprocessing pipeline with justification (missing values, outliers, features) ⭐

**⭐ Documents for Research Methodology (20 marks) and Data Pre-processing (10 marks) evaluation criteria**

## Methodology Framework

Our research follows this framework:

1. **Theoretical Foundation** → Based on energy economics, time series theory
2. **Research Design** → Exploratory → Predictive → Risk Assessment
3. **Data Collection** → EIA API + additional sources
4. **Preprocessing** → Cleaning → Feature Engineering (see `data_preprocessing_methodology.md`)
5. **Analysis** → EDA → Forecasting → Risk Analysis
6. **Model Selection** → ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, Ensemble (see `model_selection_rationale.md`)
7. **Validation** → Model validation → Sensitivity analysis (see `validation_strategy.md`)
8. **Limitations** → Document assumptions and limitations (see `limitations_assumptions.md`)
9. **Interpretation** → Findings → Recommendations
